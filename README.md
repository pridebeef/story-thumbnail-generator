## Building

`yarn build` or `yarn start` should grab the dependencies and just work.

## Google Web Fonts API Setup

You'll need an API key for Google Web Fonts if you use the font picker -- just create one from the Google Developers page and make sure to restrict it to your referrer/address and only the fonts usage.
